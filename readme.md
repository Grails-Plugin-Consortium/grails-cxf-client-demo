CXF CLIENT Demo
======

This is a project that uses the [cxf-client](https://github.com/ctoestreich/cxf-client) plugin and illustrates the usage.

<https://github.com/ctoestreich/cxf-client>

Some of the classes referred to here have full package names appended to them to ensure the correct object usage since this project is both consuming and producing its own webservice. Some object names are identical, but the package names of the cxf created objects used to consume are different than the inline objects used to expose the service.  This wouldn't normally be an issue since you probably would not consume and produce a cxf web service from the same grails project since you have direct access to call the grails service objects directly instead.

Happy Coding!
